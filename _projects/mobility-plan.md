The City of Pasadena is slowly moving toward better bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and we have been present at every step since 2013 to advocate for faster change, greater community involvement, and a more thorough network to protect our most vulnerable citizens. We continue to organize for high-quality improvements (including buffered and protected bike lanes) using a variety of tactics, including petitions, letters, and public testimony.
