How much CO2 can you save and how many donuts can you eat if you walk or bike on your next short trip? Find out with our [DonutTree Calculator](https://www.pasadenacsc.org/donut/)! 

We put this together for the Earth Day 2018 festival to show people that even small transportation changes can have real benefits for their health, as well as the environment. In particular, we wanted to give people a tangible way to understand just "how good" it could be to walk their next short trip, and we wanted it to be FUN. Hence the donuts. (But we're not averse to kale fun, stay tuned as we upgrade the calculator.)
