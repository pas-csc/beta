How much CO2 can you save and how many donuts (or kale) can you eat if you walk or bike on your next short trip? Find out with our [DonutTree Kaleculator](https://www.pasadenacsc.org/donut/)! (New! Updated for 2019 to include people who use wheelchairs, strollers, and kale!)

We put this together for the Earth Day 2018 festival to show people that even small transportation changes can have real benefits for their health, as well as the environment. In particular, we wanted to give people a tangible way to understand just "how good" it could be to walk their next short trip, and we wanted it to be **more fun to compute**. Hence the donuts. (Or kale, if you'd rather have kale fun.) Try it out - we think you'll like being the operator of our DonutTree Kaleculator.
