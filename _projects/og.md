Orange Grove Boulevard is being considered for safety improvements -- fully funded by CA state grants -- that would curb speeding and reduce the risk of traffic crashes. We're advocating for public input from the neighborhoods along Orange Grove that stand to benefit most from the economic and safety investment, including those west of Lake Ave. 

**NOTE: At this time, the Pasadena DoT is convening two working groups (east of Lake, and west of Lake) to discuss the safety concerns of various stakeholders in those two regions.**
