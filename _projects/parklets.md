A parklet is what you get when you re-imagine a parking space as...a park! We think that the creative use of public spaces is a great way to connect with people and to spark new ideas and imagination, so whenever we get a chance, we go outside for a few hours to build, dream, and play.

We often work with other local groups - [contact us](http://www.pasadenacsc.org/contact-us/) if youâ€™re interested!
