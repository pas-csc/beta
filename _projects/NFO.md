In early 2016, the North Fair Oaks Empowerment Initiative of Northwest Pasadena asked Pasadena CSC to serve as a resource as they began advocating for a **Complete Streets treatment of the North Fair Oaks corridor**. We helped them to organize a community workshop, and in 2017, their team successfully asked for and won a variety of traffic improvements. We continue to partner with the NFO Empowerment Initiative as they pursue even bigger wins for their community.
