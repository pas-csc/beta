    <h1>Walktober Spotlight: Council & Mayor Walks</h1>
    <h3>Tornek and Councilmembers Leading Themed Walks in Their Districts</h3>
<p><em>Pasadena, CA, October 17, 2019</em> -- The organizers of Walktober 2019 invite Pasadena residents in five of
our seven City Council districts to get to know their local representative on the Pasadena City Council
while exploring the uniqueness of their neighborhoods together.</p>
<p>Mayor Terry Tornek kicks off the Council walks tomorrow evening with his Mayor’s Tour of City Hall,
followed the next two weekends by walks hosted by Andy Wilson (D7), Gene Masuda (D4), Tyron
Hampton (D1), Margaret McAustin (D2), and John Kennedy (D3). (Districts 5 and 6 Councilmembers
Victor Gordo and Steve Madison were also invited to host walks, but never responded or did not respond in time.)</p>

<p>The Mayor’s and Councilmembers’ walks are an opportunity for City leadership to quite literally “walk
the walk” in supporting their Proclamation of October 2019 as Walktober and Pedestrian Safety
Month, affirming that “walkability is a healthy mode of travel that is environmentally friendly, and in
its General Plan, Pasadena has embraced the principle that people should be able to safety circulate
throughout the community without cars ... we are all pedestrians from time to time.”</p>
<p>The Mayor and CM walks are open to all, not just constituents of each district. Residents who are
unsure of their district or Councilmember can easily do so by entering an address into the City of
Pasadena’s “Find My District” <a href="https://www.cityofpasadena.net/find-my-district/">interactive online map</a>.</p>
<p>The walk titles reveal a delightful variety of themes, spotlighting Pasadena’s intellectual, natural,
cultural, artistic, and belly-pleasing facets. Councilmembers were each encouraged to choose some of
their favorite things about their district to share with their constituents.</p>
<p>District 7 Councilmember and avid pedestrian Andy Wilson notes, "In a day where many of us are
seeking solutions to traffic congestion, global warming and personal health, each of us can make a
small difference by fighting the instinct to get in our cars but instead slipping on our sneakers and
enjoying one of the most walkable cities in America. Come join me in celebrating Walktober!"</p>
<p>The latest details for the Mayor’s Tour and Councilmember walks can be found on the Walktober web
page at https://www.pasadenacsc.org/walktober2019/ and on Facebook at the Complete Streets
Coalition’s Events (@pasadenacsc).</p>
