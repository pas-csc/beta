    <h1>Walking + October + Pasadena = Walktober</h1>
    <h3>A month of events celebrating walking and Pasadena‚Äôs streets</h3>
<p><em>Pasadena, CA, October 1, 2019</em> -- The <a href="{{ site.url }}">Pasadena Complete Streets Coalition</a> (PasCSC) invites all of Pasadena to get out and WALK in October! 
</p>
<p><strong><a href="{{ site.url }}/walktober2019/">Walktober 2019</a></strong> is an annual national (and international) promotion to encourage walking, with communities from Chaska, Minnesota, to Atlanta, Georgia, to Dublin, Ireland, organizing events.</p>
<p>Here in Pasadena, PasCSC has partnered with more than 20 local organizations and community leaders to put together a <strong>month-long calendar of more than 30 group walks, tours, strolls, crawls, and walk-a-thons</strong>. </p>
<p>The slate of events reflects a wide range of reasons and ways to enjoy this deeply human activity. Be it for everyday exercise, mental health, to meet new people, learn about the city, or simply to get to work and school, we hope to inspire Pasadenans by promoting and collaborating to produce something for just about everyone. </p>
<p>Some unique highlights include:</p>
<ul><li>A superhero walk üí•</li>
<li>Urban ‚Äúforaging‚Äù with a City Councilmember üçä</li>
<li>Two walks in the Arroyo Seco: a natural history walk üçÅ and a ‚Äúwalking concert‚Äù üéµ</li>
<li>Art! History! Pocket parks! Sustainability! Gardening!</li>
<li>A three-fold reprise of Walktober 2018‚Äôs blockbuster tours of the Glenarm Power Plant üí° <em>Update: Tickets for this were gone within 20 minutes of release a few days ago. We‚Äôre hoping to add more dates.</em></li>
<li>And we‚Äôre thrilled to promote National Walk To School Day events at Jefferson and Longfellow Elementary Schools, presented by PUSD and Day One.</li></ul>
<p>In keeping with the Complete Streets mission of ‚Äústreets for everybody,‚Äù community members with impaired physical mobilities are warmly welcomed to join us, and we encourage walkers to help neighbors, friends, and family who need walking assistance to get out and enjoy Pasadena‚Äôs streets together, too. Anyone who is interested promoting their walk (or roll) on the Walktober calendar is invited to e-mail PasCSC at info [at] PasadenaCSC [dot] org.</p>
<p>On October 7th, Mayor Terry Tornek will <strong>officially proclaim the month of October 2019 as ‚ÄúWalktober‚Äù and Pasadena Pedestrian Safety Month</strong> on behalf of the Pasadena City Council. The Mayor will also be hosting a walking tour of City Hall on Friday, October 18, featuring a peek into the City‚Äôs Traffic Control Center. If you‚Äôve ever wondered how in the world the City coordinates Rose Parade traffic, this is your chance to find out!</p>
<p>On this note, excitement about Walktober 2019 has been shadowed by news of a pedestrian death last week; the victim, Michelle, was struck by a driver who claimed to not have seen her as she crossed in the crosswalk and with the walk signal. <a href="{{ site.url }}/walktober2019/press-release-sept-27/">PasCSC has decided to dedicate Walktober 2019 to Michelle and all other people who were injured or killed while walking in Pasadena in the past year.</a> <strong>We call on city leadership, the Pasadena Department of Transportation, and all people who walk at some point in their day (i.e., just about everyone) to rise up and work to make our streets places where people of all ages and mobilities are protected from injury or death.</strong></p>

<h4>Publicity:</h4>
<ul><li>Walktober posters and postcards are being distributed throughout the city.</li>
