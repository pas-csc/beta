The Glenarm Power Plant has been keeping the lights on in Pasadena since 1907, starting with the streetlights lining Glenarm and expanding to meet the City’s growing needs. A major repowering in 2016 is helping reduce the city’s fuel consumption and emissions, lower its carbon footprint, increase efficiency, and better integrate renewable energy into its grid by backstopping it with a reliable alternative when needed. The facility is an essential component of the City’s reliable supply of electricity while serving as a step toward meeting its sustainability goals. 

This tour is a rare opportunity to explore the new state-of-the-art power plant and get a glimpse into the history of the City’s power generation.

If Saturdays are your day to glean comfort and inspiration from unexpected places, look no further than this insider's tour of Caltech. Join District 7 Councilmember Andy Wilson for a walk through the history, science, and architecture of one of his favorite places in Pasadena. 

In keeping with Andy's tradition of “constituent coffee” hours, we'll be starting with coffee <em>al fresco</em> at the venerated Athenaeum, where we'll hear stories of Einstein and other scientists who have rested, pondered, and dreamed within those walls. 

At 9 AM, guided by a knowledgeable docent through Caltech's serene morning campus, we'll continue to the astonishing, futuristic Cahill Center, Caltech’s center of astronomy and astrophysics research. 

We’ll continue our time-warp walk to the celestially adorned, Spanish Revival-style Linde+Robinson Laboratory, once home to astronomers and astrophysicists who searched for our origins, and now home to interdisciplinary researchers who look into our future at the Linde Center for Global Environmental Science.

Finally, we’ll follow in the footsteps of Richard Feynman and countless Techers down to the Pie n’ Burger, where we’ll enjoy a comforting slice of warm pie while owner Mike Osborn regales us with stories of this other beloved Pasadena institution.

Due to limited capacity (30 people) and strong interest in this walk, we're doing a partially-ticketed system: 20 tickets will be available to guarantee a spot, and the remaining spots will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Tickets will be released on Wednesday, October 16, at noon, on EventBrite (see Ticket link above). Thanks for your understanding!

The Glenarm Power Plant has been keeping the lights on in Pasadena since 1907, starting with the streetlights lining Glenarm and expanding to meet the City’s growing needs. A major repowering in 2016 is helping reduce the city’s fuel consumption and emissions, lower its carbon footprint, increase efficiency, and better integrate renewable energy into its grid by backstopping it with a reliable alternative when needed. The facility is an essential component of the City’s reliable supply of electricity while serving as a step toward meeting its sustainability goals. 

This tour is a rare opportunity to explore the new state-of-the-art power plant and get a glimpse into the history of the City’s power generation.

The gracious and comfortable homes along the east bank of the Arroyo Seco contribute to one of the most beautiful and historic locations in Pasadena. Part of the original Indiana Colony land, this was the first area to be developed in the city. During the late 1880s and early 1890s many large, luxurious, Victorian-era homes were built along Grand Avenue, Orange Grove Boulevard, and the connecting side streets. Later, two Greene & Greene-designed homes were added to this prestigious street. 

At the conclusion of the tour, we'll share some sweet refreshments. Hope to see you there!

Discover Pasadena's public art as a reflection of our diversity as a community and as a source of identity and pride. Join us for a free docent-led public art tour, viewing the work of renowned local and national artists who have garnered national acclaim for the City’s collection. As diverse as the artists that create it, Pasadena’s public art ranges from a children’s playground modeled on the Arroyo Seco and art glass mirrors that tell the story of the City’s firefighters to a much larger-than-life memorial to Pasadena heroes Jackie Robinson and his brother Matthew “Mack” Robinson.

This tour will be led by Amy Ruvalcaba from <a href=""https://www.sidestreet.org/"">Side Street Projects</a>, a community-centered project that promotes socially engaged artists, youth education, and artist workshops with the goal of facilitating dialogue and creative problem solving through collaboration and hands-on artmaking.
