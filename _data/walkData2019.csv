Join us for a walking exploration of the Lower Arroyo, which holds some of Pasadena’s greatest natural and historic assets. Our 4 mile round trip will take us past La Casita del Arroyo, the archery range, the casting pond, remnants of the original Busch gardens, and the San Pasqual horse stables in South Pasadena as we take in the sights and scents of the abundant California native plants in the beautiful microclimate of the Lower Arroyo Seco. Our walk leader, Pilar, led one of our most beloved walks last year (From Angels to the Arroyo). She loves to walk all over the area and share her appreciation of its history and beauty with friends old and new.

Fall is when seeds of California native plants start to set, so we ask that you stay on the paths. The terrain is uneven and rocky, so please wear appropriate shoes. Bring water and a hat. As we will be moving at a moderate pace, please do not bring children under the age of 12.
