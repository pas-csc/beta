The Glenarm Power Plant has been keeping the lights on in Pasadena since 1907, starting with the streetlights lining Glenarm and expanding to meet the City’s growing needs. A major repowering in 2016 is helping reduce the city’s fuel consumption and emissions, lower its carbon footprint, increase efficiency, and better integrate renewable energy into its grid by backstopping it with a reliable alternative when needed. The facility is an essential component of the City’s reliable supply of electricity while serving as a step toward meeting its sustainability goals. 

This tour is a rare opportunity to explore the new state-of-the-art power plant and get a glimpse into the history of the City’s power generation.

The Glenarm Power Plant has been keeping the lights on in Pasadena since 1907, starting with the streetlights lining Glenarm and expanding to meet the City’s growing needs. A major repowering in 2016 is helping reduce the city’s fuel consumption and emissions, lower its carbon footprint, increase efficiency, and better integrate renewable energy into its grid by backstopping it with a reliable alternative when needed. The facility is an essential component of the City’s reliable supply of electricity while serving as a step toward meeting its sustainability goals. 

This tour is a rare opportunity to explore the new state-of-the-art power plant and get a glimpse into the history of the City’s power generation.

Join us for a walking exploration of the Lower Arroyo, which holds some of Pasadena’s greatest natural and historic assets. Our 4 mile round trip will take us past La Casita del Arroyo, the archery range, the casting pond, remnants of the original Busch gardens, and the San Pasqual horse stables in South Pasadena as we take in the sights and scents of the abundant California native plants in the beautiful microclimate of the Lower Arroyo Seco. Our walk leader, Pilar, led one of our most beloved walks last year (From Angels to the Arroyo). She loves to walk all over the area and share her appreciation of its history and beauty with friends old and new.

Fall is when seeds of California native plants start to set, so we ask that you stay on the paths. The terrain is uneven and rocky, so please wear appropriate shoes. Bring water and a hat. As we will be moving at a moderate pace, please do not bring children under the age of 12.

Our 4 mile round trip will take us past La Casita del Arroyo, the archery range, the casting pond, remnants of the original Busch gardens, and the San Pasqual horse stables in South Pasadena as we take in the sights and scents of the abundant California native plants in the beautiful microclimate of the Lower Arroyo Seco. Our walk leader, Pilar, led one of our most beloved walks last year (From Angels to the Arroyo). She loves to walk all over the area and share her appreciation of its history and beauty with friends old and new.","Fall is when seeds of California native plants start to set, so we ask that you stay on the paths. The terrain is uneven and rocky, so please wear appropriate shoes. Bring water and a hat. As we will be moving at a moderate pace, please do not bring children under the age of 12.

9/1-- PTU hasn’t met since our last meeting so I haven’t gotten confirmation on walk-the-vote. I’m gathering more info on whether groups are allowed to talk about topics that may be on the ballot since PTU expressed interest in talking about their campaign. I also called our county election office to better understand the training I’d need to undergo to manage a voter registration drive - no response yet. I’m hoping for more details in the coming week.",Dan,Possibly Pasadena Tenant's Union or Soroptimists,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,N,,FALSE,,,,,FREE,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,
