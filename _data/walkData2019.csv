The Glenarm Power Plant has been keeping the lights on in Pasadena since 1907, starting with the streetlights lining Glenarm and expanding to meet the City’s growing needs. A major repowering in 2016 is helping reduce the city’s fuel consumption and emissions, lower its carbon footprint, increase efficiency, and better integrate renewable energy into its grid by backstopping it with a reliable alternative when needed. The facility is an essential component of the City’s reliable supply of electricity while serving as a step toward meeting its sustainability goals. 

This tour is a rare opportunity to explore the new state-of-the-art power plant and get a glimpse into the history of the City’s power generation.

The Glenarm Power Plant has been keeping the lights on in Pasadena since 1907, starting with the streetlights lining Glenarm and expanding to meet the City’s growing needs. A major repowering in 2016 is helping reduce the city’s fuel consumption and emissions, lower its carbon footprint, increase efficiency, and better integrate renewable energy into its grid by backstopping it with a reliable alternative when needed. The facility is an essential component of the City’s reliable supply of electricity while serving as a step toward meeting its sustainability goals. 

This tour is a rare opportunity to explore the new state-of-the-art power plant and get a glimpse into the history of the City’s power generation.

Did you know water carries nutrients to cells, and hydrates skins and joints*, or that plants are comprised of about 90% water**?  Water is essential to the health of plants and people. Join the Pasadena Public Health Department’s Nutrition and Physical Activity Program (NPA) on a water-wise walking tour through historic Northwest Pasadena. 

Start at the brand new hydration station in front of La Pintoresca Library, and learn about the health benefits of water and physical activity from NPA staff. A docent will delight us with interesting facts about the area as they lead us from La Pintoresca library to Washington Elementary where we will hear from the Pasadena Audubon Society about their drought-tolerant garden. 

We will continue to our final destination, Washington Park, where volunteers from Friends of Washington Park will guide us through the native plants and butterfly garden. The walking tour is approximately 2 miles roundtrip. All participants will receive a gift bag at the end of the tour.

Join us for a walking exploration of the Lower Arroyo, which holds some of Pasadena’s greatest natural and historic assets. Our 4 mile round trip will take us past La Casita del Arroyo, the archery range, the casting pond, remnants of the original Busch gardens, and the San Pasqual horse stables in South Pasadena as we take in the sights and scents of the abundant California native plants in the beautiful microclimate of the Lower Arroyo Seco. Our walk leader, Pilar, led one of our most beloved walks last year (From Angels to the Arroyo). She loves to walk all over the area and share her appreciation of its history and beauty with friends old and new.

Fall is when seeds of California native plants start to set, so we ask that you stay on the paths. The terrain is uneven and rocky, so please wear appropriate shoes. Bring water and a hat. As we will be moving at a moderate pace, please do not bring children under the age of 12.
