One of the outcomes of this past May's Pasadena Pedestrian Safety Workshop facilitated by  CA Walks, the Pasadena City Council declared October to be Pedestrian Safety Month on Monday 9/28.  Representative from Pasadena CSC, [Walking Pasadena](), Stop 4 Aidan,  Day One, and the Downtown Pasadena Neighborhood Association attended the meeting to receive the official proclamation and to underscore the need to focus on pedestrian safety in the City.  Indeed, with 7 pedestrian fatalities over the past 5 years alone, we can do better.   

Along these lines, group members have also come together to host a series of of free community events for Pasadena's first "Walktober" (October is National Walking Month). Join us in exploring the city on two feet and learning more about how we as a community can make Pasadena even better for walking!               

### Walktober 2015 Schedule of Events      
+ Thu 10/8 (5-7pm) - Pasadena Passages Walk

Led by DPNA President, Pasadena Transportation Commissioner, and expert walker Jonathan Edwards, the guided tour will provide attendees an opportunity to learn more about City's ongoing efforts to improve comfort and safety for pedestrians, provide suggestions/input on how our City can be made safer for walking, and connect with other walking enthusiasts over drinks. The walk will take us through some of the ["Pasadena Passages"](http://www.pasadenapassages.com), a series of alleyways, streets, and courtyards that could be linked and enhanced to make the City's downtown core even more unique and walkable. *Meet in front of the Pasadena Presbyterian Church, on the northeast corner of Colorado and Madison (kitty-corner from Urth Caffe).*

+ Sun 10/25 (9am) - Colorado Blvd. Walk

Explore Pasadena's iconic Colorado Boulevard from end-to-end with the founder of Walking Pasadena (  www.walkingpasadena.com  ) Sunday October 25th! An encore of a great walk the group did in 2014, the Colorado Boulevard tour will begin at the intersection of Sierra Madre Blvd and head west to cross the Colorado Street Bridge. Walkers will then have the choice of heading back to the start,  or hopping on one of many Metro and Foothill Transit buses (fare $1.75) that traverse the corridor back to the starting point. Guided by Sarah Emery Bunn, the walk is 3.79 miles one way, approx 2 hours depending on your speed and how many times you stop to take photos.  *Meet at the corner of Sierra Madre & Colorado (in front of Vons) at 9AM.*
