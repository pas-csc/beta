Happy New Year, everyone! As we move on to 2017, we thought we'd take a look back at 2016 to remember where we've been and what we've done. July 2016 marked the beginning of our third year as a coalition, and while that in itself is a reason to celebrate...we're surprised and proud to see how *much* we actually accomplished in this past year, with little more than our enthusiasm, the past two years of experience, and sheer determination. A short selection of our activities:

### Placemaking: Parklets!
*We made a parklet...and then we made another.*

On September 16th and October 21st, we transformed curbside public parking spaces into parklets, creating temporary public parks to mark PARK(ing) Day and Pasadena's
Art Night. Our purpose was to invite passers-by to question and re-imagine how we use our publicly-owned spaces, and to demonstrate how much fun, creativity, and community participation can happen in the square footage and 2 hours that we normally use to store a car. 

The highlight of our September 16 parklet was a visit (and performance) by [Kodama Taiko](https://www.facebook.com/kodamataikopasadena) of the Pasadena JACCC!

### Bike to Work Day
On May 19, we hosted a pit stop at the Arroyo Food Co-Op in support of all folks who chose to celebrate Bike to Work Day (by biking to work, of course!) In addition to handing out homemade scones, fruit, energy bars, bike lights, and other treats, we invited visitors to share their thoughts on ideas for beautifying the nearby Wilson Avenue overpass with art and greenery.

### CicLAvia Feeder Rides
The only thing better than being able to comfortably bike to an Open Streets event is riding with friends, and thanks to new member Colin, we made it to the last two CicLAvias of this year with ample time to enjoy both events! With 18 scheduled events in 2017, including the rescheduled and much-anticipated 626 Golden Streets in our own backyard, we hope you'll have a chance to bike, walk, or ride with us this year!

### Walktober Tours
For Walktober, the Coalition sponsored two excellent and well-attended walks. On October 15, Pasadena CSC sponsored a Public Art Tour of Pasadena by Meriel Stern, Arts and Culture Commissioner.  About 20 people enjoyed learning more about Pasadena's public art, with an emphasis on ceramics. On October 22, Pasadena CSC sponsored a Pasadena Architecture tour. Local architect Wade Frazier led an extensive walking tour through Madison Heights and Caltech.  The tour was especially well-attended with over 35 attendees (including 3 dogs!)

### North Fair Oaks
The North Fair Oaks Empowerment Initiative is a team of neighbors, businesses, and local advocates working to build people power and a safer environment - including a more complete street along N Fair Oaks between Woodbury and Howard. Together, we planned and held a community Complete Streets workshop on July 23. Staff members from Pasadena DoT, Public Works, and Planning presented the Complete Streets concepts and briefed the community how to engage the city in the improvements. CSC volunteers led attendees on a "walking audit" to identify and come up with concrete ideas for change. We're excited to see the team moving forward with their ideas!

### Memorials for Alan Deane, Phillip O'Neill, and the World Day of Remembrance

Bicycling and walking are fun, healthy and sustainable modes of transportation, and we strongly believe that everyone should be able to ride and walk in comfort and safety. Unfortunately, too often people who walk and bike are vulnerable to collisions with people driving cars.  As we move towards the goal of Vision Zero for Pasadena, we remember those we have lost.  We held memorials for two Pasadena cyclists that were killed in the past five years (Phillip O'Neill and Alan Deane) and we held Pasadena's first Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on a rainy November 20th evening at City Hall.
